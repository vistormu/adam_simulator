Adam Simulator Package
======================

ADAM (Autonomous Domestic Ambidextrous Manipulator) is a mobile robot manipulator consisting of a base with two Degrees of Freedom (DoF) and two Universal Robots UR3 of 6 DoF each.

The simulation was built using [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/), a free and open source physics engine designed from the ground up for the purpose of model-based optimization, and in particular optimization through contacts.
